Hi!

We’re starting up a community of researchers who use (open) software in their work (e.g. R or Python). We have plans on running frequent but short training sessions (e.g. “Data Visualization in R”), on hosting more intensive workshops, and on informal hang outs and support sessions.

You all have expressed an interest in this type of community or requested to be on a mailing list to be updated about these types of events.

These sessions are open to anyone who: uses R, Python, or any other (open) software in their work; wants to learn more about them; wants to teach; or just needs someone to talk to about your struggles with the software (and maybe get some help at the same time!). We’d love to have you join us and get involved!

We are having an informal meetup on Sept. 27th, at 13:00 in the main lobby of the AU Library, building 1461-63 where we will introduce the community, discuss what we want or are planning to do, and to brainstorm future plans and events. To get to the area, enter the AU Library and go left to the space behind the glass wall.

All are welcome to join! We look forward to seeing you there. (Please forward this email to anyone you think may be interested.)

From the AU Community of Research Software Users (CRU)

PS: We have a website at https://au-cru.github.io/ that will list all upcoming events, materials, and resources. We're still developing it but keep an eye on it!
