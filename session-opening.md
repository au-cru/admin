# Session opening/introduction

This is what should generally be stated at each start of the session.

1. Introduce AUOC:
    - Show website, were to find events, where to go for the material.
    - Trying to develop a community to skill share, support one another, and learn
    better (and proper) ways of using R.
    - Everyone is welcome no matter your skill level!
1. If you have a passion or desire to teach, please try instructing a session!
Everyone is welcome, even if you don't know a lot of R. I am here to help guide
and provide feedback on what to teach. Plus, teaching is a great way to learn.
1. Explain that it is important to develop a community, not just a class to come
to. So we will introduce ourselves each time so we are more than just faces.
1. Introduce yourself (and pass around stickies). Then get everyone to go around
and state name, program, and department.
1. Describe what the stickies are for. One for needing help or being stuck,
another for being good to go or having finished an exercise.
1. Confirm R, RStudio, and relevant packages are installed, using the stickies.
1. Quick round of questions:
    - Who has some general knowledge about topic of session.
    - What their perceived skill level they are at.
    - Other questions that may relate to session topic.
1. For those who said they are familiar with R, if you see your neighbour with a
"help" sticky or if they are struggling, please help them! I or the helpers can
help only so many people.
1. Any questions, just email or ask!

To add later:

1. We have a Code of Conduct which can be found on our website.
